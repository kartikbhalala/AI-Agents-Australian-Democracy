Separation of powers
Law-making power in Australia is shared between the Parliament that makes the law, the Executive – government – that puts the law into action, and the Judiciary – courts – that interpret the law. According to the principle of the separation of powers, each group should work within their defined area of responsibility to keep a check on the powers of the others.
